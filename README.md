### **Biography** 
------------
I am a final-year PhD student in the Department of Physics and Department of Chemistry at King’s College London, under the supervision of Prof. Chris Lorenz and Prof. Martin Ulmschneider. Prior to this, I earned a Master’s degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

### **Research Interest** 
------------
I am broadly interested in the computational study of protein structure, dynamics, and function, particularly using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning, and structural bioinformatics. I am excited about contributing to interdisciplinary projects that combine atomistic simulations with machine learning to address challenges in biocatalysis, pharmaceutical design, and functional annotation.
