### **Biography** 
------------
I am currently a first year phD candidate student in the Department of Chemistry, King's College London (KCL), supervised by Dr Argyris Politis and Pfro 
Ismael Diez Perez. Before that, I have received a Master degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), which my tutor was Prof Chao Wang. And I also have a Bachelor degree in Biotechnology at Anhui University, under the supervision of Prof Bei Huang.

### **Research Interest** 

I am interested in developing and applying computational and experimental methods to study the structure and function of protein assemblies. Specifically, they aim to:

a) develop hybrid structural biology methods to predict the structure of large protein complexes,

b) perform mass spectrometry based experiments to generate structural restraints for capturing the flexibility and assembly pathways of transient complexes,

c) use the structural predictions to develop testable hypotheses for annotating the functions of biologically important proteins such as membrane embedded proteins and those involved in cell cycle.
