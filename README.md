### **Biography** 
------------
I am currently a second year PhD student in the Department of Chemistry/Physics, King's College London (KCL), supervised by Prof. Chris Lorenz and Pfro. Martin Ulmschneider. Before that, I have received a Master degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

### **Research Interest** 

I am currently focused on constructing intricate protein-protein interaction models at the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations. This approach will help clarify the molecular mechanisms that underpin protein complex formation, resulting in a thorough comprehension of these significant biological processes. Additionally, the models I create are expected to have valuable implications for drug discovery.
